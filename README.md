Details about the Genetic Algorithm

Genetic algorithm optimization technique in Python based on a simple example in which we are trying to maximize the output of an equation.
The code uses the decimal representation for genes, one point crossover, and uniform mutation.

The equation is:
Y = ax1 + bx2 + cx3

where a, b and c are inputs
	  x1, x2 and x3 are values between 0 and 1 such that x1+x2+x3 = 1
	  
The goal is to maximize the value of Y.
